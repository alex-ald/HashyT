# HashyT
HashyT is a node.js custom module for utilizing hashtables. The hash tables are formated to use tuples (key, value).
In this module, currently only the SDBM Hashing Algorithm is being used. Eventually multiple options will be available.

**NOTE**: HashyT is in development, and far from production use.
